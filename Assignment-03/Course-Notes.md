# Algorithm Steps
1. Imported Random library for random number generation

2. Used two for loops for iteration in range(10), to create 10X10 matrix of random integers

3. Replaced the Odd numbers in the matrix with "@" by calculating integer%2

4. Calculated the sum of each row in the matrix and appended the sum in the last column

5. Created box around the matrix with character "*".
